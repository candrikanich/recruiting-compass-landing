    id: "cost",
    question: "How much does The Recruiting Compass cost?",
    answer:
      "It's free right now. Every family that signs up during our founding period keeps full access free for life — no card, no catch. After the founding window closes, new families get a 30-day free trial, then $99/year or $12.99/month for the whole family.",

  },
  {
    id: "web-vs-ios",
    question: "What's the difference between the web app and the iOS app?",
    answer:
      "Same account, same data, synced automatically — use whichever is handy. The iOS app covers everyday recruiting work; a few tools (reports, advanced search, recommendation letters) are web-only for now.",
  },
  {
    id: "sports",
    question: "What sports do you support?",
    answer:
      "19 sports: baseball, softball, basketball, football, soccer, volleyball, beach volleyball, lacrosse, field hockey, ice hockey, track & field, cross country, swimming, wrestling, rowing, water polo, gymnastics, tennis, and golf. Each has sport-specific positions and performance metrics.",
  },
  {
    id: "calendars",
    question: "How do the recruiting calendars work?",
    answer:
      "We built 22 NCAA Division I recruiting calendars from the official 2026-27 NCAA calendars, plus Division II and Division III defaults. Pick your sport and division to see contact, evaluation, quiet, and dead periods — so you know when coaches can reach out, and when you should. Always confirm dates with the NCAA before acting on them.",
  },
  {
    id: "templates",
    question: "What are the communication templates?",
    answer:
      "30+ built-in email and text templates for every stage — introductions, follow-ups, visit requests, thank-you notes, and more. They fill in your name, sport, stats, and school details. Before your sport's NCAA contact window opens, intro templates automatically switch to a pre-window version so your first message fits the rules.",
  },
  {
    id: "recruiting-service",
    question: "Do I need to hire a recruiting service?",
    answer:
      "No. The Recruiting Compass gives you the tools to manage recruiting yourself. You'll know what to do, when to do it, and how to reach out to coaches — without paying thousands for a service.",
  },
  {
    id: "family",
    question: "Can parents and athletes share an account?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Parents and athletes join one family account — by email invite or Family Code — and see the same schools, coaches, interactions, and timeline. One family account can also track more than one athlete; switch between them from the header.",
  },
  {
    id: "privacy",
    question: "Is my data private?",
    answer:
      "Your recruiting data is private to your family, and we don't sell it. A public player profile only exists if you publish one, and you choose who gets the link. You can export your data or delete your account anytime — deletion is final after 30 days, and you can cancel it before then.",
  },
  {
    id: "too-early",
    question: "I'm a freshman. Is it too early to start?",
    answer:
      "No. The recruiting timeline starts in 9th grade. The earlier you begin tracking schools and building your profile, the more prepared you'll be when coaches start paying attention. Most families wish they'd started sooner.",
  },
  {
    id: "different",
    question: "How is this different from other recruiting platforms?",
    answer:
      "Most options are either expensive recruiting services that do the work for you, or spreadsheets. The Recruiting Compass is a management tool — structure, templates, calendars, and tracking to run your own recruiting process. You stay in control.",
  },
  {
    id: "why-no-athletic-fit",
    question: "Why don't you show an Athletic Fit or Opportunity Fit score?",
    answer:
      "We intentionally don't — only a coach knows what they're looking for and what roster spots are open. A fabricated score would give false confidence. Talk to the coach directly for that read.",
  },
